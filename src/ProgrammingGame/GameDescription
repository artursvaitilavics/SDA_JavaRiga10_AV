Programming game
The game is about asking user to program a movements for a bug on a field.
We will have rectangular field with a bug `*` put into start position (0,0).
Additionally we will put target (where bug have to come - `$`) and obstacles
(places where bug cannot step on - `#`) put on a field.
We will ask user to enter simple commands like `up`, `left`, `down`, `right`
that will move a bug one step into designated direction.
And the game will be done as soon as bug reaches target.

There is a room for improvements as well - you can think about score, for example.

Here are the steps for you to follow:
1. Define a field - 2d array. Select appropriate type.
2. Write method to print 2D array.
3. Initialize array - fill whole array with empty symbols. for example you can use spaces. Test that printing works OK.

4. Write method that will put a bug at the start position. Test that it works.
5. Write method that will randomly put a target (preferably on the farthest part of a field). Test that it works.
6. Write method that will randomly put some number of obstacles. Note obstacles should not be put on player or target.
    Don't bother with unsolvable cases where there is not possible way to get a bug to a target for now. Test this method.
7. Write method that moves a bug one tile into one of directions - up, down, left, right.
     1. Before moving - you should ensure that it is possible to move - there is no obstacle and it is not out of field.
     2. If is not possible to move - print error message and ignore movement - stay at same place
     3. If bug is stepped onto a target - the method should return true, otherwise false.
        This way we will know if a bug has reached a target.
     4. Test that all this works.
8. Now we need to implement method that will ask user to enter commands and return the commands in a useful way.
     1. We can ask user to enter only one command or multiple commands separated by comma.
     2. Each command is only one word `up`, `down`, `left` or `right`.
     3. User is allowed to enter multiple commands separated by comma: `up,down,down,left`.
     4. The method should return array of commands.
 9. All what is left - to implement main game loop.
     1. At the start of game we need to create and fill a field. You can ask user to enter field size, number of obstacles if you want.
     2. Print a field, so user can program his bug.
     2. Next - ask user to enter commands.
     3. Then execute entered commands unless all commands executed or bug has reached a target.
     4. Print new state of the field.
     4. Repeat 2, if not reached target.
     5. Display game result.
 10. Think how you can additionally improve a game.
