Inheritance Task 2

    Morse code translator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
    Create a class Letter. Create one method: public String[] getCode()
    Create method getLength, which will return length of result of getCode()
    Create a class for each letter. For example LetterA. Each should extend Letter class and override getCode.
    getCode should return array of - and . Strings according to code of each letter.
    In Main class create static method getLetter
    It should receive char letter and return Letter
    Use switch to create appropriate letter class:
       switch (letter) {
           case 'A': return new LetterA();
           case 'B': return new LetterB();
    ....
       }
    In main:
    Ask user to enter text
    Read entered text letter by letter (using for loop and `charAt` method).
    Transform letter from character into Letter using getLetter method and save it into array
    Calculate total length of all letters codes. Use letter.getLength method for that
    Create an String array of that length to put in codes of all letters
    Put all letters codes into array
    Print the array.

    Morse code
    Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes  or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after  Samuel Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.
    The International Morse Code encodes the 26 English letters A through Z, some non-English letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dâ€¦ Show more(81 kB)
